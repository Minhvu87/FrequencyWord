In this chapter, we will learn about the basics of topic modeling using a
document that contains some text. The idea here is to get the topic from the text
using certain available methods. This process falls under the category of text
mining, and plays an important role in searching as well as clustering and
organizing text. Today, it is used by many sites for recommendation purposes,
such as when news sites recommend articles based on the topic of the article that
is currently being read by the reader. This chapter covers the basics of topic
modeling, including the basic concept of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). It
will also show you how to use the MALLET package for topic modeling.
