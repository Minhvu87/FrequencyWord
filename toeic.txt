Could I have everyoneâ€™s attention, please? Due to mechanical problems, this bus will now
be taken out of service. We apologize for any inconvenience this might cause you. Please
exit the bus safely by using the front or back doors and stepping away from the side of the
road. We have contacted the main bus depot, and a shuttle bus is presently en route to our
location. The shuttles approximate arrival time is fifteen minutes. Again, we apologize for
the delay and appreciate your patience. All connecting buses will be held at the station
until our bus arrives. Are there any questions?
